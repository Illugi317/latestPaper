This tool is not perfect. There are bugs. If you spot one - please open a issue or email me and i will try my best to fix it, currently a go noob and drowning in university :)

## Why i made this?
I was looking for a tool like this but only found one for [Spigot](https://github.com/ShayBox/latestspigot) and then i challanged myself to create a clone like tool for papermc
